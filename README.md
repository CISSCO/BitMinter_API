BitMinter_API
=============

A quick PHP / Gumby Framework Interface I slapped together for BitMinter's API. Just add in your Key and preferred refresh rate.

Using Gumby Framework 1.1 (http://www.gumbyframework.com/)


How To Setup
============

1.  Clone the repo to your directory.
    * For me it's cd /srv/http/ then git clone git://github.com/Phraust/BitMinter_API.git, this will put it in http://HOST/BitMinter_API/.
2.  CHMOD the cache file so it's writeable (cd BitMinter_API then chmod 777 cache.txt).
3.  Add your preffered API KEY and Timeout to the configuration portion of index.php.
4.  I think that's pretty much it.


Anything Else
=============

This is my first git repo, and I have no idea what I'm doing.  Also, I haven't touched PHP for months, so it's probably all garbage.  If you have some suggestions, you can email me or reach me just about anytime on Freenode in #Bitminter.
